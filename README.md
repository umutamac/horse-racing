# Horse Racing Game Trial Day â€“ Front-End Case Study

## Overview
In this project, you are tasked with creating an interactive **horse racing game** with the following features:

## Requirements
1. **Technology**: You may use **Vue.js** for this project.
2. **Generate Horse List**: The horse list should contain between **1 to 20 horses**, randomly generated.
3. **Generate Race Schedule**: Upon clicking the **Generate** button, a **race schedule** consisting of **6 rounds** must be created.
4. **Start the Race**: When the **Start** button is clicked, the races should begin, running one round at a time.
5. **Display Race Results**: The results for each race should appear in the **Results field**, shown sequentially as each race concludes.
6. **Animated Horse Movement**: The horses should visibly **move** during each race.
7. **Coding Style**: Please structure your code in a way that demonstrates **clean and maintainable practices**, as if for a large-scale project.

## Rules and Conditions
1. The game should have a **total of 20 horses** available for racing.
2. Each horse should be represented with a **unique color**.
3. Each horse's **condition score** should range from **1 to 100**.
4. Each race should consist of **6 rounds**.
5. For each round, select **10 random horses** from the available 20.
6. **Round Specifications**: The rounds must occur at different lengths in the following sequence:
    - **Round 1**: 1200 meters
    - **Round 2**: 1400 meters
    - **Round 3**: 1600 meters
    - **Round 4**: 1800 meters
    - **Round 5**: 2000 meters
    - **Round 6**: 2200 meters

## Technical Expectations
1. **Vuex Store**: Implement **state management** to handle and manage the game's data.
2. **Component-Based Design**: Use **Vue components** to organize the structure of your code effectively.

## Additional Notes
1. This project is an opportunity to show your approach to **component structure**, **code organization**, and how you would handle **state management** within a complex feature. Aim to write code that is **clear**, **organized**, and **adaptable** for future scaling.
2. You are encouraged to ask questions at any time if you encounter uncertainties. **Enjoy the challenge!**

## Bonus Features
1. **Unit Tests**
2. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
